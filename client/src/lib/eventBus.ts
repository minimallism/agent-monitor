/**
 * @file eventBus.ts
 * @description Implements a simple event bus for managing WebSocket messages and connection status in the agent dashboard application. It allows components to subscribe to real-time updates from the server and react to changes in WebSocket connectivity. The event bus maintains a list of handlers for incoming messages and connection status changes, providing a clean interface for publishing events and managing subscriptions.
